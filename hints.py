I have been in here for too long now, I am starting to get really Hungry. 

It is a Wonder that I have not starved yet.

Hopefully you can help me get out of here by some sort of Magic.

If not soon, I might go Extinct...

start_stm = """Sometimes I get lost when I am reading and forget about the outside world. Like nowâ€¦ I have forgotten the code to get out of here. I am sure I left myself hints, but I feel so backwards right now.

Oh, dear! It seems I've managed to lock myself inside my own library. How embarrassing! But fear not, dear players, for I have left behind clues to aid in my escape. You see, in my world of books and imagination, one can never be truly lost without hope.

Ah-ha! Here we are. My trusty notebook. Let's see what secrets it holds...
                
To unlock the door and set me free, you must embark on a journey through the worlds of literature with me. But beware, dear players, for challenges lie ahead, and only those with keen minds and sharp wit shall prevail.
                
Will you join me on this quest for freedom? Together, we shall unravel the mysteries of this library and emerge victorious! Let the adventure begin!
